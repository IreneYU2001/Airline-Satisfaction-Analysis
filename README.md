Team Members: Bilvika Bashetty, Saketh Bollina , YiXi Yu 


This project used advanced machine learning techniques to identify key drivers of customer satisfaction and provide actionable insights for operational and marketing optimization. XGBoost emerged as the best-performing model with an AUC of 1.00, outperforming Random Forest (0.99) and Logistic Regression (0.93). Hyperparameter tuning via RandomizedSearchCV further refined the model, enhancing its predictive accuracy and robustness.

Key findings highlight the importance of optimizing pre-flight processes, such as online boarding and check-in services, to improve operational efficiency. Additionally, in-flight amenities like Wi-Fi, seat comfort, and entertainment play a critical role in ensuring customer satisfaction, particularly for long-haul flights. Segment-specific insights reveal that tailoring services to business travelers (efficiency-focused) and leisure travelers (comfort-focused) can maximize satisfaction and revenue potential.

By integrating these technical insights into strategic decision-making, airlines can enhance customer loyalty, increase operational efficiency, and achieve sustainable revenue growth in an increasingly competitive market.
